 * If you are querying for a group, you can pass any of the properties below.
 *
 * If you are querying for a Clan, you MUST NOT pass any of the following
 * properties (they must be null or undefined in your request, not just empty
 * string/default values):
 *
 * - groupMemberCountFilter - localeFilter - tagText
 *
 * If you pass these, you will get a useless InvalidParameters error.
