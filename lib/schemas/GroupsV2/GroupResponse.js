 * @property {boolean} currentUserMembershipsInactiveForDestiny A convenience property that indicates if every membership you (the current user) have that is a part of this group are part of an account that is considered inactive - for example, overridden accounts in Cross Save.
 * @property {Object.key<BungieMembershipType, GroupMember>} currentUserMemberMap This property will be populated if the authenticated user is a member of the group. Note that because of account linking, a user can sometimes be part of a clan more than once. As such, this returns the highest member type available.
 * @property {Object.key<BungieMembershipType, GroupPotentialMember>} currentUserPotentialMemberMap This property will be populated if the authenticated user is an applicant or has an outstanding invitation to join. Note that because of account linking, a user can sometimes be part of a clan more than once.
