/**
 * This represents a single "thing" being tracked by the player.
 *
 * This can point to many types of entities, but only a subset of them will
 * actually have a valid hash identifier for whatever it is being pointed to.
 *
 * It's up to you to interpret what it means when various combinations of these
 * entries have values being tracked.
 * @type DestinyProfileTransitoryTrackingEntry
 * @property {number?} locationHash OPTIONAL - If this is tracking a DestinyLocationDefinition, this is the identifier for that location. Mapped to DestinyLocationDefinition in the manifest.
 * @property {number?} itemHash OPTIONAL - If this is tracking the status of a DestinyInventoryItemDefinition, this is the identifier for that item. Mapped to DestinyInventoryItemDefinition in the manifest.
 * @property {number?} objectiveHash OPTIONAL - If this is tracking the status of a DestinyObjectiveDefinition, this is the identifier for that objective. Mapped to DestinyObjectiveDefinition in the manifest.
 * @property {number?} activityHash OPTIONAL - If this is tracking the status of a DestinyActivityDefinition, this is the identifier for that activity. Mapped to DestinyActivityDefinition in the manifest.
 * @property {number?} questlineItemHash OPTIONAL - If this is tracking the status of a quest, this is the identifier for the DestinyInventoryItemDefinition that containst that questline data. Mapped to DestinyInventoryItemDefinition in the manifest.
 * @property {string?} trackedDate OPTIONAL - I've got to level with you, I don't really know what this is. Is it when you started tracking it? Is it only populated for tracked items that have time limits?
I don't know, but we can get at it - when I get time to actually test what it is, I'll update this. In the meantime, bask in the mysterious data.
