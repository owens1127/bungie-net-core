/**
 * This component provides a quick lookup of every item the requested character has
 * and how much of that item they have.

 * Requesting this component will allow you to circumvent manually putting together
 * the list of which currencies you have for the purpose of testing currency
 * requirements on an item being purchased, or operations that have costs.
 *
 * You *could* figure this out yourself by doing a GetCharacter or GetProfile
 * request and forming your own lookup table, but that is inconvenient enough that
 * this feels like a worthwhile (and optional) redundency. Don't bother requesting
 * it if you have already created your own lookup from prior GetCharacter/
 * GetProfile calls.
