 * @property {DestinyPresentationNodeState} state This enum represents a set of flags - use bitwise operators to check which of these match your value.
 * @property {DestinyObjectiveProgress} objective An optional property: presentation nodes MAY have objectives, which can be used to infer more human readable data about the progress. However, progressValue and completionValue ought to be considered the canonical values for progress on Progression Nodes.
 * @property {number} progressValue How much of the presentation node is considered to be completed so far by the given character/profile.
 * @property {number} completionValue The value at which the presentation node is considered to be completed.
 * @property {number?} recordCategoryScore If available, this is the current score for the record category that this node represents.
