/**
 * Information about milestones, presented in a character state-agnostic manner.
 * Combine this data with DestinyMilestoneDefinition to get a full picture of the
 * milestone, which is basically a checklist of things to do in the game. Think of
 * this as GetPublicAdvisors 3.0, for those who used the Destiny 1 API.
 * @type DestinyPublicMilestone
 * @property {number} milestoneHash The hash identifier for the milestone. Use it to look up the DestinyMilestoneDefinition for static data about the Milestone. Mapped to DestinyMilestoneDefinition in the manifest.
 * @property {DestinyPublicMilestoneQuest[]} availableQuests A milestone not need have even a single quest, but if there are active quests they will be returned here.
 * @property {DestinyPublicMilestoneChallengeActivity[]} activities 
 * @property {number[]} vendorHashes Sometimes milestones - or activities active in milestones - will have relevant vendors. These are the vendors that are currently relevant.
Deprecated, already, for the sake of the new "vendors" property that has more data. What was I thinking.
 * @property {DestinyPublicMilestoneVendor[]} vendors This is why we can't have nice things. This is the ordered list of vendors to be shown that relate to this milestone, potentially along with other interesting data.
 * @property {string?} startDate If known, this is the date when the Milestone started/became active.
 * @property {string?} endDate If known, this is the date when the Milestone will expire/recycle/end.
 * @property {number} order Used for ordering milestones in a display to match how we order them in BNet. May pull from static data, or possibly in the future from dynamic information.
 * @see {@link https://bungie-net.github.io/#/components/schemas/Destiny.Milestones.DestinyPublicMilestone}
