/**
 * Represents localized, extended content related to Milestones. This is
 * intentionally returned by a separate endpoint and not with Character-level
 * Milestone data because we do not put localized data into standard Destiny
 * responses, both for brevity of response and for caching purposes. If you really
 * need this data, hit the Milestone Content endpoint.
 * @type DestinyMilestoneContent
 * @property {string} about The "About this Milestone" text from the Firehose.
 * @property {string} status The Current Status of the Milestone, as driven by the Firehose.
 * @property {string[]} tips A list of tips, provided by the Firehose.
 * @property {DestinyMilestoneContentItemCategory[]} itemCategories If DPS has defined items related to this Milestone, they can categorize those items in the Firehose. That data will then be returned as item categories here.
 * @see {@link https://bungie-net.github.io/#/components/schemas/Destiny.Milestones.DestinyMilestoneContent}
