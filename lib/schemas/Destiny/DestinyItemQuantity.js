/**
 * Used in a number of Destiny contracts to return data about an item stack and its
 * quantity. Can optionally return an itemInstanceId if the item is instanced - in
 * which case, the quantity returned will be 1. If it's not... uh, let me know okay?
 * Thanks.
 * @type DestinyItemQuantity
 * @property {number} itemHash The hash identifier for the item in question. Use it to look up the item's DestinyInventoryItemDefinition. Mapped to DestinyInventoryItemDefinition in the manifest.
 * @property {string?} itemInstanceId If this quantity is referring to a specific instance of an item, this will have the item's instance ID. Normally, this will be null.
 * @property {number} quantity The amount of the item needed/available depending on the context of where DestinyItemQuantity is being used.
 * @property {boolean} hasConditionalVisibility Indicates that this item quantity may be conditionally shown or hidden, based on various sources of state. For example: server flags, account state, or character progress.
 * @see {@link https://bungie-net.github.io/#/components/schemas/Destiny.DestinyItemQuantity}
