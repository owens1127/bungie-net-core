     * NOTE: I had a lot of hemming and hawing about whether these should be keyed by
     * collectible hash or item hash... but ultimately having it be keyed by item hash
     * meant that UI that already uses DestinyItemComponentSet data wouldn't have to
     * have a special override to do the collectible -> item lookup once you delve into
     * an item's details, and it also meant that you didn't have to remember that the
     * Hash being used as the key for plugSets was different from the Hash being used
     * for the other Dictionaries. As a result, using the Item Hash felt like the least
     * crappy solution.
     *
     * We may all come to regret this decision. We will see.
