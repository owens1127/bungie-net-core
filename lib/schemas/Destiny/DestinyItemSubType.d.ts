/**
 * This Enumeration further classifies items by more specific categorizations than
 * DestinyItemType. The "Sub-Type" is where we classify and categorize items one
 * step further in specificity: "Auto Rifle" instead of just "Weapon" for example,
 * or "Vanguard Bounty" instead of merely "Bounty".
 *
 * These sub-types are provided for historical compatibility with Destiny 1, but an
 * ideal alternative is to use DestinyItemCategoryDefinitions and the
 * DestinyItemDefinition.itemCategories property instead. Item Categories allow for
 * arbitrary hierarchies of specificity, and for items to belong to multiple
 * categories across multiple hierarchies simultaneously. For this enum, we pick a
 * single type as a "best guess" fit.
 *
 * NOTE: This is not all of the item types available, and some of these are
 * holdovers from Destiny 1 that may or may not still exist.
 * @see {@link https://bungie-net.github.io/#/components/schemas/Destiny.DestinyItemSubType}
