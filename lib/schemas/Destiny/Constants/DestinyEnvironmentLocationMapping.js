/**
 * @type DestinyEnvironmentLocationMapping
 * @property {number} locationHash The location that is revealed on the director by this mapping. Mapped to DestinyLocationDefinition in the manifest.
 * @property {string} activationSource A hint that the UI uses to figure out how this location is activated by the player.
 * @property {number?} itemHash If this is populated, it is the item that you must possess for this location to be active because of this mapping. (theoretically, a location can have multiple mappings, and some might require an item while others don't) Mapped to DestinyInventoryItemDefinition in the manifest.
 * @property {number?} objectiveHash If this is populated, this is an objective related to the location. Mapped to DestinyObjectiveDefinition in the manifest.
 * @property {number?} activityHash If this is populated, this is the activity you have to be playing in order to see this location appear because of this mapping. (theoretically, a location can have multiple mappings, and some might require you to be in a specific activity when others don't) Mapped to DestinyActivityDefinition in the manifest.
 * @see {@link https://bungie-net.github.io/#/components/schemas/Destiny.Constants.DestinyEnvironmentLocationMapping}
