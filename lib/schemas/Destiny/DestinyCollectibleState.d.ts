/**
 * A Flags Enumeration/bitmask where each bit represents a different state that the
 * Collectible can be in. A collectible can be in any number of these states, and
 * you can choose to use or ignore any or all of them when making your own UI that
 * shows Collectible info. Our displays are going to honor them, but we're also the
 * kind of people who only pretend to inhale before quickly passing it to the left.
 * So, you know, do what you got to do.
 *
 * (All joking aside, please note the caveat I mention around the Invisible flag:
 * there are cases where it is in the best interest of your users to honor these
 * flags even if you're a "show all the data" person. Collector-oriented compulsion
 * is a very unfortunate and real thing, and I would hate to instill that
 * compulsion in others through showing them items that they cannot earn. Please
 * consider this when you are making your own apps/sites.)
 *
 * This enum represents a set of flags - use bitwise operators to check which of
 * these match your value.
 * @see {@link https://bungie-net.github.io/#/components/schemas/Destiny.DestinyCollectibleState}
