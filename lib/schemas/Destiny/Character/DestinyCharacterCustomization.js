 * You can look up the relevant class/race/gender combo in

 * up these values within the CustomizationOptions found to pull some data about
 * their choices. Warning: not all of that data is meaningful. Some data has useful
 * icons. Others have nothing, and are only meant for 3D rendering purposes (which
