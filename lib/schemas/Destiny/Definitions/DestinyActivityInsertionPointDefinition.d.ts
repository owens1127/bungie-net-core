 *
 * UPDATE: Turns out this information isn't actually useless, and is in fact
 * actually useful for people. Who would have thought? We still don't have
 * localized info for it, but at least this will help people when they're looking
 * at phase indexes in stats data, or when they want to know what phases have been
 * completed on a weekly achievement.
