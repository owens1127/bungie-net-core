/**
 * The properties of an individual checklist item. Note that almost everything is
 * optional: it is *highly* variable what kind of data we'll actually be able to
 * return: at times we may have no other relationships to entities at all.
 *
 * Whatever UI you build, do it with the knowledge that any given entry might not
 * actually be able to be associated with some other Destiny entity.
 * @type DestinyChecklistEntryDefinition
 * @property {number} hash The identifier for this Checklist entry. Guaranteed unique only within this Checklist Definition, and not globally/for all checklists.
 * @property {DestinyDisplayPropertiesDefinition} displayProperties Even if no other associations exist, we will give you *something* for display properties. In cases where we have no associated entities, it may be as simple as a numerical identifier.
 * @property {number?} destinationHash Mapped to DestinyDestinationDefinition in the manifest.
 * @property {number?} locationHash Mapped to DestinyLocationDefinition in the manifest.
 * @property {number?} bubbleHash Note that a Bubble's hash doesn't uniquely identify a "top level" entity in Destiny. Only the combination of location and bubble can uniquely identify a place in the world of Destiny: so if bubbleHash is populated, locationHash must too be populated for it to have any meaning.
You can use this property if it is populated to look up the DestinyLocationDefinition's associated .locationReleases[].activityBubbleName property.
 * @property {number?} activityHash Mapped to DestinyActivityDefinition in the manifest.
 * @property {number?} itemHash Mapped to DestinyInventoryItemDefinition in the manifest.
 * @property {number?} vendorHash Mapped to DestinyVendorDefinition in the manifest.
 * @property {number?} vendorInteractionIndex 
 * @property {DestinyScope} scope The scope at which this specific entry can be computed.
 * @see {@link https://bungie-net.github.io/#/components/schemas/Destiny.Definitions.Checklists.DestinyChecklistEntryDefinition}
