/**
 * By public demand, Checklists are loose sets of "things to do/things you have
 * done" in Destiny that we were actually able to track. They include easter eggs
 * you find in the world, unique chests you unlock, and other such data where the
 * first time you do it is significant enough to be tracked, and you have the
 * potential to "get them all".
 *
 * These may be account-wide, or may be per character. The status of these will be
 * returned in related "Checklist" data coming down from API requests such as
 * GetProfile or GetCharacter.
 *
 * Generally speaking, the items in a checklist can be completed in any order: we
 * return an ordered list which only implies the way we are showing them in our own
 * UI, and you can feel free to alter it as you wish.
 *
 * Note that, in the future, there will be something resembling the old D1 Record
 * Books in at least some vague form. When that is created, it may be that it will
 * supercede much or all of this Checklist data. It remains to be seen if that will
 * be the case, so for now assume that the Checklists will still exist even after
 * the release of D2: Forsaken.
 * @see {@link https://bungie-net.github.io/#/components/schemas/Destiny.Definitions.Checklists.DestinyChecklistDefinition}
