/**
 * Many actions relating to items require you to expend materials: - Activating a
 * talent node - Inserting a plug into a socket The items will refer to material
 * requirements by a materialRequirementsHash in these cases, and this is the
 * definition for those requirements in terms of the item required, how much of it
 * is required and other interesting info. This is one of the rare/strange times
 * where a single contract class is used both in definitions *and* in live data
 * response contracts. I'm not sure yet whether I regret that.
 * @type DestinyMaterialRequirement
 * @property {number} itemHash The hash identifier of the material required. Use it to look up the material's DestinyInventoryItemDefinition. Mapped to DestinyInventoryItemDefinition in the manifest.
 * @property {boolean} deleteOnAction If True, the material will be removed from the character's inventory when the action is performed.
 * @property {number} count The amount of the material required.
 * @property {boolean} countIsConstant If true, the material requirement count value is constant. Since The Witch Queen expansion, some material requirement counts can be dynamic and will need to be returned with an API call.
 * @property {boolean} omitFromRequirements If True, this requirement is "silent": don't bother showing it in a material requirements display. I mean, I'm not your mom: I'm not going to tell you you *can't* show it. But we won't show it in our UI.
