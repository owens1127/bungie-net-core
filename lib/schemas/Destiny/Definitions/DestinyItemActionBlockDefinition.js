/**
 * If an item can have an action performed on it (like "Dismantle"), it will be
 * defined here if you care.
 * @type DestinyItemActionBlockDefinition
 * @property {string} verbName Localized text for the verb of the action being performed.
 * @property {string} verbDescription Localized text describing the action being performed.
 * @property {boolean} isPositive The content has this property, however it's not entirely clear how it is used.
 * @property {string} overlayScreenName If the action has an overlay screen associated with it, this is the name of that screen. Unfortunately, we cannot return the screen's data itself.
 * @property {string} overlayIcon The icon associated with the overlay screen for the action, if any.
 * @property {number} requiredCooldownSeconds The number of seconds to delay before allowing this action to be performed again.
 * @property {DestinyItemActionRequiredItemDefinition[]} requiredItems If the action requires other items to exist or be destroyed, this is the list of those items and requirements.
 * @property {DestinyProgressionRewardDefinition[]} progressionRewards If performing this action earns you Progression, this is the list of progressions and values granted for those progressions by performing this action.
 * @property {string} actionTypeLabel The internal identifier for the action.
 * @property {string} requiredLocation Theoretically, an item could have a localized string for a hint about the location in which the action should be performed. In practice, no items yet have this property.
 * @property {number} requiredCooldownHash The identifier hash for the Cooldown associated with this action. We have not pulled this data yet for you to have more data to use for cooldowns.
 * @property {boolean} deleteOnAction If true, the item is deleted when the action completes.
 * @property {boolean} consumeEntireStack If true, the entire stack is deleted when the action completes.
 * @property {boolean} useOnAcquire If true, this action will be performed as soon as you earn this item. Some rewards work this way, providing you a single item to pick up from a reward-granting vendor in-game and then immediately consuming itself to provide you multiple items.
 * @see {@link https://bungie-net.github.io/#/components/schemas/Destiny.Definitions.DestinyItemActionBlockDefinition}
