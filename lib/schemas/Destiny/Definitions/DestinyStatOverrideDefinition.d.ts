 * Stat Groups (DestinyStatGroupDefinition) has the ability to override the
 * localized text associated with stats that are to be shown on the items with
 * which they are associated.
 *
 * This defines a specific overridden stat. You could theoretically check these
 * before rendering your stat UI, and for each stat that has an override show these
 * displayProperties instead of those on the DestinyStatDefinition.
 *
 * Or you could be like us, and skip that for now because the game has yet to
 * actually use this feature. But know that it's here, waiting for a resilliant
 * young designer to take up the mantle and make us all look foolish by showing the
 * wrong name for stats.
 *
 * Note that, if this gets used, the override will apply only to items using the
 * overriding Stat Group. Other items will still show the default stat's name/
 * description.
