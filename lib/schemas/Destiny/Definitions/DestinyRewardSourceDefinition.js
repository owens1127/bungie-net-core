/**
 * Represents a heuristically-determined "item source" according to Bungie.net.
 * These item sources are non-canonical: we apply a combination of special
 * configuration and often-fragile heuristics to attempt to discern whether an item
 * should be part of a given "source," but we have known cases of false positives
 * and negatives due to our imperfect heuristics.
 *
 * Still, they provide a decent approximation for people trying to figure out how
 * an item can be obtained. DestinyInventoryItemDefinition refers to sources in the
 * sourceDatas.sourceHashes property for all sources we determined the item could
 * spawn from.
 *
 * An example in Destiny 1 of a Source would be "Nightfall". If an item has the "
 * Nightfall" source associated with it, it's extremely likely that you can earn
 * that item while playing Nightfall, either during play or as an after-completion
 * reward.
 * @type {typeof DestinyRewardSourceDefinition}
 * @see {@link https://bungie-net.github.io/#/components/schemas/Destiny.Definitions.DestinyRewardSourceDefinition}
