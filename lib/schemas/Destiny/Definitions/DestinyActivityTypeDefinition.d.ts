/**
 * The definition for an Activity Type.
 *
 * In Destiny 2, an Activity Type represents a conceptual categorization of
 * Activities.
 *
 * These are most commonly used in the game for the subtitle under Activities, but
 * BNet uses them extensively to identify and group activities by their common
 * properties.
 *
 * Unfortunately, there has been a movement away from providing the richer data in
 * Destiny 2 that we used to get in Destiny 1 for Activity Types. For instance,
 * Nightfalls are grouped under the same Activity Type as regular Strikes.
 *
 * For this reason, BNet will eventually migrate toward Activity Modes as a better
 * indicator of activity category. But for the time being, it is still referred to
 * in many places across our codebase.
 * @see {@link https://bungie-net.github.io/#/components/schemas/Destiny.Definitions.DestinyActivityTypeDefinition}
