/**
 * A subclass of DestinyItemQuantity, that provides not just the item and its
 * quantity but also information that BNet can - at some point - use internally to
 * provide more robust runtime information about the item's qualities.
 *
 * If you want it, please ask! We're just out of time to wire it up right now. Or a
 * clever person just may do it with our existing endpoints.
 * @type DestinyMilestoneQuestRewardItem
 * @property {number?} vendorHash The quest reward item *may* be associated with a vendor. If so, this is that vendor. Use this hash to look up the DestinyVendorDefinition. Mapped to DestinyVendorDefinition in the manifest.
 * @property {number?} vendorItemIndex The quest reward item *may* be associated with a vendor. If so, this is the index of the item being sold, which we can use at runtime to find instanced item information for the reward item.
 * @property {number} itemHash The hash identifier for the item in question. Use it to look up the item's DestinyInventoryItemDefinition. Mapped to DestinyInventoryItemDefinition in the manifest.
 * @property {string?} itemInstanceId If this quantity is referring to a specific instance of an item, this will have the item's instance ID. Normally, this will be null.
 * @property {number} quantity The amount of the item needed/available depending on the context of where DestinyItemQuantity is being used.
 * @property {boolean} hasConditionalVisibility Indicates that this item quantity may be conditionally shown or hidden, based on various sources of state. For example: server flags, account state, or character progress.
