/**
 * An individual Destiny Entity returned from the entity search.
 * @type DestinyEntitySearchResultItem
 * @property {number} hash The hash identifier of the entity. You will use this to look up the DestinyDefinition relevant for the entity found.
 * @property {string} entityType The type of entity, returned as a string matching the DestinyDefinition's contract class name. You'll have to have your own mapping from class names to actually looking up those definitions in the manifest databases.
 * @property {DestinyDisplayPropertiesDefinition} displayProperties Basic display properties on the entity, so you don't have to look up the definition to show basic results for the item.
 * @property {number} weight The ranking value for sorting that we calculated using our relevance formula. This will hopefully get better with time and iteration.
 * @see {@link https://bungie-net.github.io/#/components/schemas/Destiny.Definitions.DestinyEntitySearchResultItem}
