/**

 * They have nodes which map to activities, and other various visual elements that

 *
 * Activity graphs, most importantly, have nodes which can have activities in
 * various states of playability.
 *
 * Unfortunately, activity graphs are combined at runtime with Game UI-only assets
 * such as fragments of map images, various in-game special effects, decals etc...
 * that we don't get in these definitions.
 *
 * If we end up having time, we may end up trying to manually populate those here:
 * but the last time we tried that, before the lead-up to D1, it proved to be
 * unmaintainable as the game's content changed. So don't bet the farm on us
 * providing that content in this definition.
