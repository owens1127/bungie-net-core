   * Do you ever get the feeling that a system was designed *too* flexibly? That it

   * easy to use abstraction for the mess that's happening under the surface?
   *
   * Let's talk about character-specific data that might be related to items without
   * instances. These two statements are totally unrelated, I promise.
   *
   * At some point during D2, it was decided that items - such as Bounties - could be
   * given to characters and *not* have instance data, but that *could* display and
   * even use relevant state information on your account and character.
   *
   * Up to now, any item that had meaningful dependencies on character or account
   * state had to be instanced, and thus "itemComponents" was all that you needed: it
   * was keyed by item's instance IDs and provided the stateful information you
   * needed inside.
   *
   * Unfortunately, we don't live in such a magical world anymore. This is
   * information held on a per-character basis about non-instanced items that the
   * characters have in their inventory - or that reference character-specific state
   * information even if it's in Account-level inventory - and the values related to
   * that item's state in relation to the given character.
   *
   * To give a concrete example, look at a Moments of Triumph bounty. They exist in a
   * character's inventory, and show/care about a character's progression toward
   * completing the bounty. But the bounty itself is a non-instanced item, like a mod
   * or a currency. This returns that data for the characters who have the bounty in
   * their inventory.
   *
   * I'm not crying, you're crying Okay we're both crying but it's going to be okay I
   * promise Actually I shouldn't promise that, I don't know if it's going to be okay
